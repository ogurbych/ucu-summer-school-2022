# Deep Reinforcement Learning for High-Frequency Trading

This repository contains source code for the course "Deep Reinforcement Learning for High-Frequency Trading" at the Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU) / Czech Technical University (CTU) in July 2022.

## Course description

Sooner or later, every Data Scientist meets with general financial tasks and automation of trading on a stock exchange – in particular. But not every Data Scientist knows how to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning to these assignments effectively. This course is designed to teach you just that – with real examples.
